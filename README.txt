Credits to: Daryl and Jason, for allowing us to modify their parcer class for this assignment

General:
Jin:	I'm thinking of implementing a new header file and a new cpp to implement the features of the compiler.
		No point creating a huge class for everything. What do you think? I created advancedParserClasses for this purpose.

Part 1:
Jin:	Mostly done, TA pointed out that this does not work if (bla bla) a = 0 (resolved)
		Listed some possibilities at the getAssignmentStatements function (resolved)
Part 2:

Part 3:
Jin:	For this part, I'm thinking we check through for any syntax errors first, then check for any other types of errors (Yes)

Bonus:

Misc:
I am unable to get pass the parserClass. I don't know what is happening. It says that the string position is invalid (unresolved)
